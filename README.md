# Angular-Auth-App
Example MEAN-stack project

>*I made this authentication app as a reference work. I used MongoDB, ExpressJs, NodeJs and Angular12.*

## To run this app:

 - Clone the repo.
- In the root folder/config/database.js file you can find the database connection link, copy there your database link. (I used mongo shell). If you are using mongo shell, start it in command line and switch to your database.
- In the root folder run: **npm install** and **nodemon app.js** to launch the server.
- In the exampleangular/src/app folder run command line and type: **ng serve** to start angular.
- Open the browser and visit http://http://localhost:4200/

## In the app:
- You can register, login, edit user's data, delete user, check all registered users.
